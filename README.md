InDevr
==========================
Indevr is a social project management app for software developers. Users can create and find projects they can build together with others, or find "friends" with similar interests to keep up on the leatest trends and news. It is a full stack website created usign React+Redux, Node/Express, PostGresSQL and 'glamor' styling package. This is a group project created during my time at DevMountain. The primary takeaways from this group endeavor are Git versioning and branches for teams, and endpoint testing using Postman and Unit testing using Jest. The full site is available at www.indevr.io
